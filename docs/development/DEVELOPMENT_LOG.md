# Development Log — Maxwell_Daemon

State table for every feature in flight in this repository. Update
entries **in place**; never append dated sections. One entry per
feature, from proposal to ship. See the `development-logs` section of
`AGENTS.md` for the binding rules and
`shared_scripts/development_log.py` for the validator.

- **Portfolio:** infra
- **WIP limit:** 4
- **Last audited:** 2026-08-28 by bootstrap

## States

`proposed` → `in_progress` → `in_review` → `shipped`, with `parked`
reachable from any live state and `abandoned` from `parked`.
`shipped` never returns to `in_progress`; open a new entry instead.
